    <h2> Chocolate cake that will make all other chocolate cakes pale in comparison</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
      </ul>

    <h3> Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 175Â°C. Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the boiling water while stirring the batter continuously. The batter will be thin, but that's okay.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter equally between the prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Once the cakes have cooled, you can frost them with your favorite chocolate frosting.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
